# Loop Tasks Program

This repository contains a beginner-friendly Python program that demonstrates the use of loops in Python. It covers **for loops**, **while loops**, **break & continue**, **string iteration**, **multiplication table**, **range with steps**, **conditional logic inside loops**, and **real-world loop examples**.

---

## 📌 Objectives

The program covers the following tasks:

1. Create a Python script named `loop_tasks.py`
2. Use `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 100
3. Use `while` loop for a countdown timer
4. Implement `break` and `continue` statements
5. Iterate over string characters
6. Generate a multiplication table
7. Use `range()` with steps
8. Combine loop with conditions (even/odd)
9. Add real-world examples using loops

## 📂 Program Overview

The program demonstrates:

* Printing numbers using a `for` loop
* Countdown using a `while` loop
* Using `break` to exit a loop and `continue` to skip iterations
* Iterating over characters of a string
* Generating a multiplication table
* Using `range()` with step value
* Combining loops with conditions (even/odd)
* Real-world examples like shopping cart and attendance list
